## Category 1: THE INVISIBLE

**Landing Page:** `/invisible`

### Email Version A: Direct Approach

**Subject:** {business_name} - you're hard to find online

**Preview:** Searched for you. Here's what I found (or didn't).

---

Hi {first_name},

I was looking for electricians in {city} and came across {business_name}.

Actually, that's not true. I couldn't find you.

No Google listing. No website showing up. Your competitors are getting the calls that should be going to you.

I know you're busy doing actual work - not messing with websites. But here's the thing: **97% of people search online before hiring an electrician.**

If they can't find you, they hire someone else.

I put together a quick report showing exactly what's missing and what it's costing you.

No sales pitch. Just the data.

P.S. This takes 2 minutes to review. Could change everything.

### Email Version B: Curiosity Approach

**Subject:** Quick question about {business_name}

**Preview:** Something seemed off when I searched...

---

{first_name},

Weird question - do you get most of your jobs from referrals?

I ask because when I searched for electricians in {city}, {business_name} didn't come up.

That's fine if referrals keep you busy. But if you've ever wondered why the phone doesn't ring more...

I made a short video showing exactly what potential customers see when they search for electricians in your area. (Spoiler: they see your competitors.)

## Category 2: THE DIY CEILING

**Landing Page:** `/upgrade`

### Email Version A: Empathy Approach

**Subject:** Your {cms_platform} site did its job

**Preview:** Time to graduate.

---

Hi {first_name},

I noticed {business_name} is running on {cms_platform}.

Look, I get it. When you're starting out, you build what you can afford. DIY website builders are fine for getting something up.

But you're not starting out anymore.

You've got {review_count} reviews. You've built something real. And that {cms_platform} site? It's like wearing your first work boots to a client meeting.

I mocked up what a professional site for {business_name} could look like. Not a template - something that actually matches the quality of your work.

**[See Your Custom Mockup →]**

Takes 30 seconds. No commitment.

### Email Version B: Competitive Angle

**Subject:** Your competitors upgraded. You?

**Preview:** I compared your site to theirs.

---

{first_name},

Spent some time looking at electrician websites in {city} last night.

Noticed a pattern: the ones showing up on page 1 don't look like DIY jobs anymore.

{business_name} has great reviews ({google_rating} stars, {review_count} reviews). But your site is competing against companies that invested in looking professional.

Not trying to be harsh. Just showing you what customers see when they compare options.

**I put together a side-by-side comparison.** Your site vs. what converts.

## Category 3: THE LEAKY BUCKET

**Landing Page:** `/convert`

### Email Version A: Data-Driven

**Subject:** {business_name} website leak identified

**Preview:** You're losing leads here.

---

{first_name},

Ran your site through our conversion analyzer. Found something interesting.

{business_name} actually gets decent traffic. You're doing something right.

But your conversion rate is probably under 1%. Industry average for electricians is 3-5%.

Translation: **For every 100 visitors, you're losing 2-4 leads you should be getting.**

At your average job value, that's probably ${estimated_loss}/month walking out the door.

I recorded a 3-minute video walkthrough showing exactly where visitors drop off.

P.S. The #1 leak I found? {primary_leak}. Easy fix.

---

### Email Version B: Question Approach

**Subject:** Quick question: where do your website visitors go?

**Preview:** They come. Then they leave. Why?

---

{first_name},

Your website gets visitors. I can see that.

But here's what I can't see: where they go after they leave.

Based on what's on your site (no online booking, {missing_element}), they're probably:
- Calling whoever's easier to reach
- Leaving to "think about it" and forgetting
- Comparing you to competitors who made it easier

**Your traffic isn't the problem. Your conversion is.**

I made a list of the 5 specific things that need to change. Quick read.

## Category 4: THE OVERWHELMED

**Landing Page:** `/scale`

### Email Version A: Empathy + Solution

**Subject:** {first_name}, you're too busy to be this busy

**Preview:** There's a better way to grow.

---

{first_name},

{review_count} reviews. {google_rating} stars. Business is clearly good.

But let me guess:
- Phone rings while you're on a job
- Leads slip through text message cracks
- Calendar is either double-booked or in your head
- Nights and weekends = quotes and invoices

Sound about right?

Here's the thing: **you don't have a business problem. You have a systems problem.**

More marketing won't help. It'll make things worse. What you need is infrastructure.

I've helped electricians go from "drowning in work" to "running a real operation."

**[See the Systems That Scale →]**

15 minutes could save you 15 hours/week.

### Email Version B: Direct Pain

**Subject:** Missed another call today?

**Preview:** Probably happened while you read this.

---

{first_name},

Quick math:

You miss maybe 10 calls a week (everyone does). Let's say 30% would have been jobs. At your average ticket, that's ${weekly_loss}/week. **${monthly_loss}/month.**

Not because you're bad at what you do. Because you're too busy doing it to answer the phone.

The fix isn't "hire an office person." The fix is systems that:
- Answer when you can't
- Book customers automatically
- Follow up without you lifting a finger

**I built these systems for electricians like you.** Happy to show you how they work.

## Category 5: READY TO DOMINATE

**Landing Page:** `/dominate`

### Email Version A: Peer Positioning

**Subject:** {business_name} vs. the top 3 in {city}

**Preview:** What separates "good" from "dominant"

---

{first_name},

Looked at the top electricians in {city}. Then I looked at {business_name}.

You're good. {google_rating} stars, {review_count} reviews, solid foundation.

But you're not dominating.

The top guys aren't better electricians. They're better at:
- Showing up first (SEO, ads)
- Converting visitors (website optimization)
- Building moats (reputation velocity, referral systems)

**You're one strategy away from joining them.**

I mapped out exactly what it would take for {business_name} to own {city}.

**[See the Domination Roadmap →]**

This isn't for everyone. But if you're tired of competing and ready to lead, let's talk.

### Email Version B: Challenge Approach

**Subject:** Ready to stop competing and start dominating?

**Preview:** Only for electricians who want to be #1.

---

{first_name},

Most electricians want to be successful.

You want to be **the** electrician in {city}. The one everyone calls first. The one competitors study.

I can tell because:
- {google_rating} stars, {review_count} reviews - you've built something
- Your site actually works (rare)
- You're investing in growth (why else would you read this?)

**But "good" doesn't win markets. "Dominant" does.**

I've helped 3 electricians become the #1 in their markets this year. Same playbook every time.

Want to see it?

We only work with 3 new clients/month. Not a scarcity tactic - just capacity.
