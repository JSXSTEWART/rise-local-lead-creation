## Category 1: THE INVISIBLE

**URL Slug:** `/invisible` or `/get-found`

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
# Your Best Work Deserves to Be Seen

**Subheadline:**
Right now, homeowners in [CITY] are searching for electricians online. They're finding your competitors instead of you.

**CTA Button:** Get My Free Visibility Report

---

### Problem Section

**Section Header:** The Hard Truth About Being Invisible Online

Every day, [CITY] homeowners search Google for "electrician near me." They need panel upgrades. They need rewiring. They need emergency repairs.

**And they can't find you.**

Not because you're not good at what you do. You've got the skills. You've got the license. You've got years of experience.

But if you're not online, you might as well not exist.

**The math is brutal:**
- 97% of people search online before hiring a local service
- The top 3 Google results get 75% of all clicks
- If you're invisible, you're losing jobs to competitors every single day

---

We build complete digital presences for electricians who are ready to stop being the best-kept secret in town.

**What You Get:**

- Review generation system to build your reputation fast

Your Wix/Squarespace site got you started. But it's costing you customers now.

**CTA Button:** See What's Possible

---

### Problem Section

**Section Header:** Your DIY Site Is Holding You Back

You did the smart thing. You built a website yourself to save money. Wix. Squarespace. GoDaddy. Whatever worked.

**And it did work. For a while.**

But now you're noticing:
- Customers mention your site looks "basic" or "not professional"
- You can't add the features you need without breaking everything
- Your competitors' sites look way better than yours
- You're spending hours fighting with the builder instead of doing electrical work

Here's what nobody tells you about DIY website builders: **They're designed for beginners, not for businesses that want to grow.**

You've outgrown the tool. It's not your fault. It's just time.

---

## Category 3: THE LEAKY BUCKET

**URL Slug:** `/stop-losing-leads` or `/convert`

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
# Visitors Are Coming. They're Just Not Calling.

**Subheadline:**
Your website gets traffic. But something's broken between "visit" and "hire."

**CTA Button:** Find My Leaks

---

### Problem Section

**Section Header:** You Have a Conversion Problem

Here's what's probably happening:

Homeowners find your website. They look around. They maybe even like what they see.

**Then they leave. And call someone else.**

It's not that your website is ugly. It's that it's not built to convert visitors into customers.

**Common Leaks We Find:**
- No clear call-to-action ("What do I do next?")
- No online booking (they have to call during business hours)
- No trust signals (why should they trust you?)
- No urgency (they'll "come back later" and never do)
- Phone number buried at the bottom

Every leak costs you money. Every day.

---

### Solution Section

**Section Header:** Plug the Leaks. Keep the Leads.

We turn leaky websites into lead-generating machines.

**The Fix:**
1. **Conversion Audit** - We find exactly where visitors drop off
2. **Strategic Redesign** - Every element optimized to drive action
3. **Booking Integration** - Let customers schedule 24/7
4. **Trust Building** - Reviews, badges, guarantees front and center
5. **Follow-Up Systems** - Capture leads who aren't ready yet

**The Goal:** No more wondering "where did that lead go?"

---

### The Math Section

**Section Header:** What's a Leaky Website Costing You?

Let's do the math:
- Your site gets 500 visitors/month
- Industry average conversion: 3-5%
- Your conversion (probably): <1%

**You should be getting 15-25 leads/month.**
**You're probably getting 3-5.**

At $500 average job value, that's **$5,000-10,000/month** walking out the door.

---

### CTA Section

**Headline:** Every Day You Wait, More Leads Leak Out

**Body:** Get a free conversion audit that shows exactly where you're losing customers.

**Form Fields:**
- Website URL
- Monthly Visitor Estimate (dropdown)
- Business Name
- Phone

**Button:** Find My Leaks

**Microcopy:** We'll record a video walkthrough of your site showing every leak.

## Category 4: THE OVERWHELMED

**URL Slug:** `/scale` or `/stop-drowning`

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
# More Jobs Than Hours. Sound Familiar?

**Subheadline:**
Your business is growing. But without the right systems, growth becomes chaos.

**CTA Button:** Get Control Back

---

### Problem Section

**Section Header:** Success Without Systems = Burnout

You're busy. Really busy. That's the good news.

The bad news? You're:
- Answering the phone while on a job site
- Losing track of leads in text messages and voicemails
- Double-booking because your calendar is in your head
- Working nights and weekends on quotes and invoices
- Missing calls from customers ready to pay

**Growth is breaking you.**

And here's the scary part: If you can't handle the volume now, what happens when you grow more? You either:
1. Cap your growth (leave money on the table)
2. Burn out (leave the industry)
3. Build systems (scale sustainably)

---

### Solution Section

**Section Header:** Systems That Scale With You

We build the operational backbone that lets you grow without losing your mind.

**What You Get:**
- **CRM System** - Never lose another lead
- **Online Booking** - Customers schedule themselves
- **Automated Follow-ups** - Leads get nurtured without you lifting a finger
- **Job Management** - Track every project from lead to invoice
- **Review Automation** - Build reputation on autopilot

**The Result:** You focus on the work. Systems handle the rest.

---

### ROI Section

**Section Header:** The Math of Getting Organized

**Current Reality:**
- 20% of leads lost to poor follow-up
- 3 hours/day on admin work
- 10 missed calls/week

**With Systems:**
- 95%+ lead capture rate
- 30 minutes/day on admin
- Zero missed opportunities

That's $6,000+ in recovered revenue. Every month.

**Subheadline:**
You've got the foundation. Now let's turn you into the electrician everyone calls first.

**CTA Button:** Show Me The Plan

---

### Problem Section

**Section Header:** Good Isn't Good Enough Anymore

You've done a lot right:
- Solid website
- Good reviews
- Decent online presence

But you're not dominating. Not yet.

**What's missing:**
- You rank on page 1, but not position 1
- You get referrals, but not market share
- You're profitable, but not scaling
- Competitors are catching up

**In a competitive market, "good" is just the floor.**

The electricians who dominate their markets aren't just good at electrical work. They're good at positioning, marketing, and capturing demand.

---

**Tier 1: Own Local Search**

- Email/SMS marketing for repeat business
- Review velocity to outpace competitors

**Tier 3: Build the Moat**
- Brand positioning that commands premium pricing
- Content marketing for long-term authority
- Referral systems that run on autopilot

---
